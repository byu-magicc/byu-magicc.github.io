# Project Name

Write a mid-length summary here. We want this to give a good overview of the project's work and focus, but not be so in-depth that it starts to sound like a publication.

Include any pictures, videos, slides, posters, etc. you want here. Small files can be included directly in the `docs/research/current_projects/assets/{your project name here}` folder (less than 10mb in size), but anything larger should be put elsewhere (YouTube, Box) and embedded externally. Also, MAKE SURE YOU ARE ALLOWED TO SHARE ANY FILES PUBLICLY BEFORE POSTING THEM HERE.

## Sponsors

List any sponsors and relevant links here. Also feel free to summarize their involvement if you want.

## Personel

List anyone involved with the project here. You can even link to their individual webpages if you want.
