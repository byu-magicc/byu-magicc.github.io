## About

Brandon is a Doctoral student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department with Dr. McLain as his advisor. He joined the MAGICC lab in Febuary 2021 and graduated from BYU with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering in April 2024.

Brandon first became interested in aerial robotics when he learned to build and fly FPV racing drones, where he began to obsess over how to get the fastest control response possible out of autopilot. He also enjoys mountain biking, building random things, and reading books in his spare time.

## Research

Brandon has been involved in a number of projects in the lab, most recently ROSflight as an undergraduate and now Cooperative GPS-Denied Navigation as a doctoral student. Brandon is currently working on non-invasive methods of adopting cooperative multi-agent navigation systems onto existing Kalman Filter based single-agent systems.
