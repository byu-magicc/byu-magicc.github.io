## About

David is a PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department advised by Dr. James Usevitch, exploring provably safe classical and learning-based control methods for autonomous systems. His prior master's work under Dr. Tim McLain focused on precision landing of eVTOL vehicles in GPS-denied environments. Outside of his research David loves to play sports, practice the piano, and catch up on watching One Piece with his wife.
