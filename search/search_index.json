The lab was founded by professors Randy Beard and Tim McLain in 1999 and is located in room 146 of the BYU Engineering Building.</p> <p></p> <p>Coordinated control of multiple vehicle teams is an active research area. The motivation for multiple vehicle teams is to achieve the same gains for mechanically controlled systems as has been gained in distributed computation. Rather than having a single monolithic (and therefore expensive and complicated) machine do everything, the hope is that many inexpensive, simple machines, can achieve the same, or enhanced functionality, through coordination. In essence, the objective is to replace expensive complicated hardware with coordination software. There are numerous applications for multiple vehicle teams including space-based interferometry, future autonomous combat systems, autonomous household items, enhanced surveillance, hazardous material handling, and active reconfigurable sensing. </p> <p>A significant early achievement of the lab is the development of the Kestrel autopilot and the development of algorithms to extend the cooperative and autonomous capabilities of the platform. The Kestrel autopilot was licensed to and sold by Procerus Technologies which was acquired by Lockheed Martin in 2012.</p>"},{"location":"publications/","title":"Publications","text":""},{"location":"publications/#2025","title":"2025","text":""},{"location":"publications/#infrared-constellation-aided-landing-of-evtol-aircraft","title":"Infrared-Constellation-Aided Landing of eVTOL Aircraft","text":"<p>This paper presents an active fiducial light pattern localization (AFLPL) system to aid the navigation of an eVTOL aircraft during landing without reliance on GPS. AFLPL utilizes a constellation of active fiducial IR lights arranged to enable localization of the aircraft using an onboard IR camera and algorithms for detection, data association, and pose estimation. In experimental tests conducted onboard a multirotor aircraft, the AFLPL system achieved pose estimates at a rate of 33 Hz, with ranges extending up to 200 m and accuracies ranging from 2 to 3 m, down to decimeter-level accuracy at ranges under 40 m. When fused with IMU measurements through an extended Kalman filter (EKF), pose estimates were produced at 200 Hz, with accuracies under 1 m at larger ranges down to sub-decimeter precision at ranges below 40 m. Using pose estimates from the AFLPL-based EKF in a position-feedback loop, accurate tracking of glide-slope landing trajectory by a multirotor aircraft was demonstrated.</p>"},{"location":"publications/#safety-for-time-varying-parameterized-sets-using-control-barrier-function-methods","title":"Safety for Time-Varying Parameterized Sets Using Control Barrier Function Methods","text":"<p>Accepted to the 2025 American Control Conference, Denver, CO.</p> <p>A fundamental and classical problem in mobile autonomous systems is maintaining the safety of autonomous agents during deployment. Prior literature has presented techniques using control barrier functions (CBFs) to achieve this goal. These prior techniques utilize CBFs to keep an isolated point in state space away from the unsafe set. However, various situations require a non-singleton set of states to be kept away from an unsafe set. Prior literature has addressed this problem using nonsmooth CBF methods, but no prior work has solved this problem using only \"smooth\" CBF methods. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a novel method of applying CBF methods to non-singleton parameterized convex sets. The method ensures differentiability of the squared distance function between ego and obstacle sets by leveraging a form of the log-sum-exp function to form strictly convex, arbitrarily tight overapproximations of these sets. Safety-preserving control inputs can be computed via convex optimization formulations. The efficacy of our results is demonstrated through multi-agent simulations.</p>"},{"location":"publications/#external-lists","title":"External Lists","text":"<p>Dr. Tim McLain</p> <ul>

The Kestrel uses a Rabbit Microprocessor which is programmed with all the code necessary to coordinate onboard electronics with the ground station. The autopilot is getting ever smaller, with the most recent version weighing just 16 grams and measuring less than 2 in X 2 in.</p> <p>The Kestrel autopilot has been developed into a commercial product available for purchase through Procerus small autopilot Technologies. BYU's MAGICC lab and senior capstone projects have been crucial in the development and production of these conveniently small autopilot chips that are being used by the Air Force.</p> <p>pda-demo-short_clip_big.jpg While the plane can be flown entirely by the autopilot, commands are sent to the plane through a ground station which consists of a laptop computer, a modem, and an optional video receiver. The laptop computer uses a software program called Virtual Cockpit to control the plane's path and to receive telemetry data from the plane. Virtual Cockpit has evolved into a robust program, capable of controlling multiple planes in a single console, and has even been adapted to be run off of a PDA (Portable Digital Assistant) as shown in the movie at right (Click to watch).</p> <p>Recently, the Magicc autopilot has increased its auto-takeoff and auto-land capabilities. This feature makes it possible for each plane to be autonomous from the beginning to the end, ending the need for RC control during UAV missions. Just throw the plane and click the mouse, and the Zagi flies its mission. The pictures below are links to videos that demonstrate the auto-takeoff and auto-land features.</p> <p>Currently, the autopilot is based off of PID feedback control loops and manual gain-tuning. However, Josh Matthews, a graduate student, has recently developed adaptive control algorithms to automatically tune gains and has incorporated this into the autopilot code. Adaptive control allows the planes to fly without having to specify each of the gains. This vastly diminishes prep time and gives the planes the capability to respond to instantaneous problems in real-time. The algorithms he is using allow planes to adapt to conditions such as a broken aileron or a shift in weight.</p>"},{"location":"research/projects/auvsi_senior_project/","title":"AUVSI Senior Project","text":""},{"location":"research/projects/auvsi_senior_project/#auvsi-senior-project","title":"AUVSI Senior Project","text":"<p>The ECEN department at Brigham Young University is introducing a new senior project beginning Winter 06.

The difficulty with current cooperative control solutions is that they lack the ability to learn or to improve performance of mission objectives. Without the ability to learn, a UAS may not adapt to dynamically changing environments which may result in poor mission performance or even mission failure. Multi-agent learning has been studied in the computer science (CS) community for a long time. The learning approaches that have come out of the CS community may not be suitable for real world challenges since real applications require large state space models.

An optical flow field can be computed from the video and compared against an idealized motion field computed from the motion of the aircraft and the elevation map.

This technology is not new, but the Magicc lab tries to use effective and innovative approaches to solve this problem.One example of image-directed control is Computer Vision. In fact, computer vision is an extensive field that focuses on making computers \"see\" by recognizing objects and responding. As part of the Mars Lander project, sponsored by NASA'a JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory), we have enabled our UAVs to sense a parachute deployed by a fellow UAV and follow it until the plane reaches the ground. At this point, the airborne plane continues to orbit over the fallen plane to aid in recovery.</p> <p>Another example of image-directed control is called Optic Flow. Currently, we are working with an Australian University which has experience in optic flow sensing in order to build our own optic-flow-capable UAVs. Optic flow tracks information \"flowing\" past a skinny camera, often with a small resolution line of pixels. By tracking how quickly information passes through the sensor, the plane can sense how far away it is from obstacles and can be programmed to avoid them. Obstacle avoidance is a major field in UAV research which is necessary to make them safe and marketable. Capabilities such as computer vision and optic flow make our UAVs smarter and more robust.</p> <p>One current of example of using image-directed control on real planes is demonstrated by the work of David Casbeer, a graduate student at BYU. His work shows how a team of UAVs can help firefighters track the growth of forest fires. First, upon discovery of a fire, the UAV team converges and begins to circle the perimeter of the fire.</p> <p>As the planes travel, they track how far they've gone and send this information to each other and to the ground station. This allows firefighters to know how quickly the fire is growing and keeps them from getting trapped by rapidly expanding flames. David's work includes modeling the fire growth in the computer and planning coordination routines for the planes in order to most effectively relay information. The movie clip to the left demonstrates the growing fire simulation and a single plane approaching it and beginning to circle.</p> <p>The planes use image-direction to track the perimeter of the fire. Therefore, this project includes many aspects of Magicc research: first, it relies on an effectively running autopilot system; second, it requires the coordination of multiple agents in a single project; and third, it requires image-directed capability in order to track the fire. This is one way in which UAVs can be an effective commercial product as well.

This type of environment imposes significant challenges on the design of the vehicle. We cannot assume anything about the structure of the environment (e.g. vertical walls, flat floors, etc.). We are also denied access to outside navigation aids (e.g. GPS, or radio beacons). An appropriate vehicle will need to be relatively small and agile, and it will need to develop its own representation (i.e. map) of the environment online using its own sensor data.</p> <p> </p> <p>Several techniques and technologies, each with its own set of design tradeoffs, must be used to address these challenges. Navigating through an unknown environment without external references requires some type of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. The complex nature of the environment precludes popular sensors such as 2D scanning laser rangefinders; inherently 3D sensors such as stereo or RGB-D cameras must be used. Finally, any vehicle suitable for this environment will be constrained by its size, weight, and power (SWAP) limitations. Limited computational resources follow as a natural consequence.</p> <p>We acquired an eight camera motion capture system from Motion Analysis Corp. in the spring of 2010, and our efforts on this project began the following fall. We have adopted the MikroKopter family of multirotor helicopters as our aerial platform. These helicopters are agile, relatively inexpensive, and capable of carrying significant payload for their size. However, multirotor helicopters have undamped dynamics that require accurate estimates of states, especially velocity, be fed back frequently to the autonomous control. In the summer of 2011 we developed a state estimation scheme based on an improved dynamic model that produces accurate state estimates based primarily in high-rate IMU data. The estimates only require infrequent (approx. 5-10 Hz) updates from an exteroceptive sensing algorithm.</p> <p>We have adopted the Microsoft Kinect\u00ae as our preferred exteroceptive sensor. The Kinect provides an RGB image at 30 Hz along with depth data for each pixel measured by an IR emitter and receiver. In the Spring of 2011 and the Spring of 2012 we developed a visual odometry algorithm for the Kinect capable of producing relative position and orientation estimates at nearly 30 Hz. The visual odometry algorithm can be used along with saved images and a place recognition algorithm to develop a locally\u2011metric, globally\u2011topological SLAM map sufficient for persistent, repeatable navigation.</p> <p>We have recently added a Microstrain 3DM-GX3-15 IMU, which has helped to improve our estimation results considerably.</p> <p>Cortex3DGraphic.png IMG_1333.jpeg Xbox-360-Kinect-Standalone.png</p> <p> </p> <p>Our current efforts center on: - Refining the visual odometry algorithm; - Integrating the estimator with the real-time control and path planning of the vehicle; - Developing an innovative approach to back-end optimization that more efficiently creates a globally\u2011metric representation of the environment.</p> <p>Most published work on indoor navigation makes strong assumptions about the structure of the environment. We aim to relax these assumptions that others use to allow scanning laser rangefinders or simplified vision processing. The bulk of the literature also describes systems that depend on globally referenced states for navigation; our approach allows globally referenced information to be refined outside of the time critical navigation routines. Future work could involve a variety of tasks such as more sophisticated path planning (e.g. balancing competing mission requirements), higher level behaviors (e.g. interacting with objects in the environment), or cooperation between multiple vehicles.</p>"},{"location":"research/projects/indoor_navigation/#personnel","title":"Personnel","text":"<p>John Macdonald Robert Leishman Stephen Quebe</p>"},{"location":"research/projects/indoor_navigation/#sponsor","title":"Sponsor","text":"<p>This project is primarily funded through the Department of Defense SMART Scholarship program.</p>"},{"location":"research/projects/indoor_navigation/#project-duration","title":"Project Duration","text":"<p>Until we graduate</p>"},{"location":"research/projects/indoor_navigation/#publications","title":"Publications","text":"<p>R.

To ensure that UAVs do not disrupt other airspace users, they must be integrated into the current National Airspace System (NAS), through the development of detailed and comprehensive rules, procedures, policies, standards and regulation that allow for safe, accident-free aviation. However proving that UAVs have the capability to provide the Equivalent Level of Safety (ELOS) as manned aviation remains a challengeig issue. Since the beginning of manned flight the primary method for avoiding midair collisions has been a pilot's eyes. Even with the introduction of radio communication, radar, and air trac control (ATC), the FAA has maintained the requirement for a pilot to actively search the sky for other airspace users and maneuver to avoid collision. While creating a robust system to identify intruder aircraft is an integral piece of the SAA problem, the development of a Collision Avoidance System (CAS) is equally important. If UAVs are to be integrated seamlessly alongside piloted aircraft, they must react to collision threats in the same way as a human pilot. In any encounter scenarios that occurs, the UAV's avoidance maneuver must conform to the standard fight rules followed by piloted aircraft.This work will aim to develop and implement a collision avoidance approach based on a chain placed in a force field. The chain-based strategy was initially presented by MAGICC lab researchers to plan a path as a planner that models the UAV path using a series of connected waypoints. The waypoints serve as the links of a simulated chain. The chain is placed in a force-field generated using the gradient of a bounded differentiable reward function. This causes each link in the chain to move toward local maxima of the reward function. Other forces are applied to prevent UAV fight constraints from being violated. Since the path is represented using waypoints that are a fixed distance apart, it is easy to determine roughly where the UAV will be at any given time. This timing information can be used to prevent collisions and spread out paths when creating plans for multiple UAVs.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"research/projects/sense_and_avoid_for_unmanned_aircraft_systems/#personnel","title":"Personnel","text":"<ul> <li>Dr. Randy Beard</li> <li>Dr. Tim Mclain</li> <li>Laith Sahawneh</li> <li>Robert Klaus</li> </ul>"},{"location":"research/projects/sense_and_avoid_for_unmanned_aircraft_systems/#sponsor","title":"Sponsor","text":"<p>This project is funded by Utopia Compression Corporation and Air Force Research Laboratory.</p>"},{"location":"research/projects/sense_and_avoid_for_unmanned_aircraft_systems/#project-duration","title":"Project Duration","text":"<p>January 2012 - December 2012</p>"},{"location":"research/projects/sense_and_avoid_for_unmanned_aircraft_systems/#publications","title":"Publications","text":"<p>[1] Sahawneh, Laith, Beard, Randal W., Avadhanam, Sharath, Bai, He. \"Chain-based Collision Avoidance for UAS Sense-and-Avoid Systems\", AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference, Boston, August, 2013.</p>"},{"location":"research/projects/tactical_seeability/","title":"Tactical Seeability","text":""},{"location":"research/projects/tactical_seeability/#tactical-seeability","title":"Tactical Seeability","text":"<p>Unmanned Air Systems (UASs) are used to strategically position aerial sensors, such Electro-Optical or Infra-Red cameras, to perform surveillance, tracking, and other missions.

The targeting task performance (TTP) metric developed by Volmerhaussen and Jacobs is the state of the art method to estimate the probability of an operator sucessfully performing DRI tasks. Unfortunately, there is no previously existing method to estimate the probability of an operator successfully performing DRI tasks when observing video. For this reason, we extend the TTP metric by developing the video TTP (VTTP) metric.</p> <p>When observing images, object size, resolution, and contrast with the background are significant factors in determining whether or not an operator wil find the desired object. These factors are all considered when calculating the TTP value. When observing video, at least two additional components are needed. Blur due to motion and where the object is located in the video frame both affect the probability of an operator detecting the object. The VTTP metric is calculating the TTP value of a hypothetical object at a terrain point within the video, and then scaling the TTP value based on the amount of motion.</p>"},{"location":"research/projects/tactical_seeability/#project-members","title":"Project Members","text":"<p>Dr. Randy Beard, Dr. Bryan Morse, Dr. Stephen Pledgie, Peter Niedfeldt, Brandon Carroll, and Joel Howard</p>"},{"location":"research/projects/tactical_seeability/#project-timeline","title":"Project Timeline","text":"<p>Phase 1: December 2008 - July 2009</p> <p>Phase 2: August 2009 - October 2011</p>"},{"location":"research/projects/tactical_seeability/#publications","title":"Publications","text":"<p>P.
