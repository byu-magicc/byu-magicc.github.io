The BYU <b>M</b>ultiple <b>AG</b>ent <b>I</b>ntelligent <b>C</b>oordination and <b>C</b>ontrol <b>Lab</b>, also known as the **MAGICC Lab** focuses on research involving navigation, guidance, and control of teams of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The lab was founded by professors Randy Beard and Tim McLain in 1999 and is located in room 146 of the BYU Engineering Building.

Coordinated control of multiple vehicle teams is an active research area. The motivation for multiple vehicle teams is to achieve the same gains for mechanically controlled systems as has been gained in distributed computation. Rather than having a single monolithic (and therefore expensive and complicated) machine do everything, the hope is that many inexpensive, simple machines, can achieve the same, or enhanced functionality, through coordination. In essence, the objective is to replace expensive complicated hardware with coordination software. There are numerous applications for multiple vehicle teams including space-based interferometry, future autonomous combat systems, autonomous household items, enhanced surveillance, hazardous material handling, and active reconfigurable sensing. 

A significant early achievement of the lab is the development of the [Kestrel autopilot](http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/procerus/kestrel-autopilot.html) and the development of algorithms to extend the cooperative and autonomous capabilities of the platform. The [Kestrel autopilot](http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/procerus/kestrel-autopilot.html) was licensed to and sold by [Procerus Technologies](http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/procerus.html) which was acquired by Lockheed Martin in 2012.
