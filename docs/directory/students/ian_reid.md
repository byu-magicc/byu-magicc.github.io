## About

Ian Reid is a Electrical Engineering Master's student under Dr. McLain. He has been working in the MAGICC lab since 2022. 

He has an undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering from BYU.
He is sucker for a good problem to solve no matter what it may be.
Ian enjoy's carpentry, working on his ailing truck and is a space nerd fanatic.
He has succesfully started and sold a business, and started another making a window washing drone and FAA remote ID modules.

Ian loves to solve problems in sensible ways, looking for unexpected connections between problems and pushing the edge of research in autonomous systems.

## Research

### Current Projects
Ian is researching state estimation, with a special focus on comparison between state estimation paradigms. 

He is currently working on ROSflight, a lean open source autopilot.
It aims to be easily modifiable and understandable for reasearch applicaitons.
He is also working on comparisons of cutting edge state estimation algorithms for multirotors, fixedwings and eVTOLs.
