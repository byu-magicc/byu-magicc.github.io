# Aerial Recovery

Aerial Recovery project studies the retrieval strategies for Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) which are unable to return home by themselves. The basic concept is shown in the following figure.
The mothership recovers a MAV by towing a long cable attached to a drogue. The drogue is actuated and maneuver and communicate with the MAV to facilitate successful capture. The MAV uses missile guidance strategies to intercept the drogue.

### Drogue Orbit Regulation by Mothership Orbit Maneuver

### Given a desired trajectory of the drogue, a motion planning strategy based on differential flatness is employed to calculate the desired trajectory for the mothership.

### Vision Based Rendezvous of MAV

### Actuated Drogue Design

### Flight Test
