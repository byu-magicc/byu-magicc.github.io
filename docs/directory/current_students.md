EDITING GUIDELINES

The directory is organized with Material for MkDocs' grid feature.

To add an entry to this page, we need to two things:
1. Add a photo and entry to the current_student.md page.
2. Copy the template student page and fill it with your information.

To do the first:
Copy the template below and add it inside the <div> HTML blocks for the correct section. Replace all `first` and `last` with your own name. Copy a professional photo of yourself named first_last.jpg (or .png, just make sure to update the filepath on the grid entry too) to the docs/directory/assets folder, cropped to be square and no larger than 600x600 in resolution, to keep webpage load times quick.

To do the second:
Copy the template.md file in the docs/directory/students folder, renaming your copy to first_last.md of your name. Populate each section of the template with your information.

Once you've done this follow the instructions in the README.md to build and host the webpage locally (it's much easier than it sounds) and make sure everything looks good with your additions. Also, check out the documentation for Material for MkDocs to learn about what you can do with your page: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/

All student pages, past and current, are found in this directory so their URLs don't change when they get moved from current to past.
