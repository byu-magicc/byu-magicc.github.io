# Robust Landing for UAVs in Maritime Environments

Precision landing of UAVs is a topic of increasing interest, especially in maritime environments due to the potentially catastrophic effect of a failed landing and the naturally dynamic environment.
In this project, we developed a method that enables precision landing of a UAV on a boat-like platform using 1) only RTK GPS and 2) RTK-GPS and vision-based localization.

We conducted flight test results and showed that the RTK-only solution was able to achieve precision landings with an accuracy of 10 centimeters.
