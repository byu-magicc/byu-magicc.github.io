# Cooperative GPS-Denied Navigation

Localization can be difficult when GPS signals are corrupted or lost due to adversarial spoofing, jamming, or environmental conditions such as underground, underwater environments, or urban canyons. Multi-agent systems can improve localization estimates by efficiently covering larger areas, reducing uncertainty through shared sensor data, and creating a comprehensive representation of unknown environments from various perspectives.

Our research includes using factor graphs for decentralized multi-agent estimation, navigation and control of UAS in GPS denied scenarios with limited communication between vehicles, outlier rejection using group-k consistent measurement set maximization, and semantic multi-view localization using heterogeneous teams of agents.
