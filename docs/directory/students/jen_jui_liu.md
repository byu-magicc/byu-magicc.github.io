## About

### Education
I’m Jen‑Jui Liu, a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Brigham Young University, advised by Prof. Randy Beard.

### Research Interests
My research focuses on vision-guided UAV autonomy, with a particular emphasis on real-time path planning and collision avoidance in dynamic environments.

### Professional Background
Before my doctoral studies, I worked as a Principal Engineer in the systems industry, where I developed expertise in machine learning and pattern recognition.
