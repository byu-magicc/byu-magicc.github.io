# Project Name

Write a mid-length summary here. We want this to give a good overview of the project's work and focus, but not be so in-depth that it starts to sound like a publication. Many website visitors are just going to skim this page, so we want the most important information easily presented. As such, we ask that EACH PROJECT HAS AT LEAST ONE VISUAL (more is better) describing their project.

Include any pictures, videos, slides, posters, etc. you want. Small files can be included directly in the `docs/research/projects/assets/{your project name here}` folder (less than 10mb in size), but anything larger should be put elsewhere (YouTube, Box) and embedded externally. Also, MAKE SURE YOU ARE ALLOWED TO SHARE ANY FILES PUBLICLY BEFORE POSTING THEM HERE.

This template is intended to act as a starting point, but feel free to make modifications as you need to suit the needs of your project. Just try to make it look cohesive with the rest of the current projects.

## Sponsors

List any sponsors and relevant links here. Also feel free to summarize their involvement if you want.

## Videos

Notice the `embed` link here. You'll want to copy the part of your YouTube link between `.../watch?v=` and `&...` into the link segment right after `.../embed/`. The original link for this video was `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMWN0OI-7pA&list=PLYgEzAHuTvsB92GTxdTiCdQNb5b1RMUl8&index=4`.
