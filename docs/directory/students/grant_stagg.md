## About


Grant is a Doctoral student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Brigham Young University, advised by Dr. Cameron Peterson. He earned his Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from BYU in 2021.

His research focuses on path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in adversarial and uncertain environments, with an emphasis on algorithms that account for environmental uncertainty, sensor limitations, and intelligent adversaries. These methods aim to enable autonomous systems to operate more safely and effectively in challenging conditions.

## Research

Grant’s research spans three core areas within UAV guidance and path planning:  

- **Probabilistic Engagement Zones (PEZs)** – Develops mathematical models that allow UAVs to reason about threats from adversaries under uncertainty, characterizing the probability of engagement based on pursuer and evader capabilities to enable safer mission planning in contested environments.  

- **Radar-Aware Path Planning** – Creates trajectory optimization methods that both reduce uncertainty in radar parameters and avoid detection, addressing unknown radar characteristics such as location, power, and detection profile.  

- **Hazard-Aware Path Planning** – Designs algorithms for cooperative multi-agent exploration and mapping of environmental hazards, enabling UAV teams to efficiently locate and characterize hazardous regions in uncertain environments.
