### [Infrared-Constellation-Aided Landing of eVTOL Aircraft](https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2025-1538)

This paper presents an active fiducial light pattern localization (AFLPL) system that uses an IR camera and a constellation of IR lights to provide accurate pose estimates for eVTOL aircraft landing without GPS. When fused with an IMU via an EKF, the system provided sub-decimeter precision at ranges below 40 m and successfully demonstrated accurate tracking of a landing trajectory.

### [Safety for Time-Varying Parameterized Sets Using Control Barrier Function Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12003)

_Accepted to the 2025 American Control Conference, Denver, CO._

This paper introduces a novel method for autonomous system safety that uses *smooth* Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to keep entire sets of states—not just single points—away from unsafe areas. The technique leverages log-sum-exp functions to create smooth overapproximations of these sets, allowing safety-preserving controls to be computed via convex optimization, which was validated in multi-agent simulations.
