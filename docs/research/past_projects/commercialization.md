# Commercialization

BYU is the home to a Center of Excellence for Unmanned Vehicle Technology. Under the Center of Excellence funding, the MAGICC Lab seeks to develop technologies that can be marketed in the real world. Procerus Technologies licenses much of the MAGICC Lab's technology such as the Kestrel Autopilot and the Virtual Cockpit Software.
