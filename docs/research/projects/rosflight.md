ROSflight is a lightweight, open-source flight control firmware and software stack designed for research-oriented unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), particularly multirotors and fixed-wing aircraft.
Its primary motivation is to provide a simple, well-documented, and easily modifiable platform for academic and experimental robotics applications, avoiding much of the complexity of autopilots like ArduPilot or PX4.

Extensive documentation on the project can be found at the [ROSflight website](https://rosflight.org/).
